# ML_python
Machine Learning exercise from Coursera Machine_Learning course, in python.

## ex3
This program load MNIST dataset and pre-trained Neural Network parameters from .mat file, and make prediction and plot each images.
* ex3data1.mat: MNIST data
* ex3weights.mat: pre-trained neural net parameters
* ex3nn.py: main script, loads data needed and make predictions
* preict_func.py: sigmoid and forward propagation.
