### Feedforward Neural Network on FashionMNIST

- This is the neural network built from scrach without machine leanring libraries. Only libraries used was...
* NumPy: Matrix operations
* SciPy: sigmoid function
* Pandas: data preprocessing
* Matplotlib: visualization
* Time: measures training time

fashionMNIST dataset was used.

It imports and uses three python files, fashion_data_import.py, ac.py, and functions.py.

- fashion_data_import.py: imports the datasets from data/ folder, and preprocess it into 
numpy array, and return them.

- function.py: includes all functions needed for the NN, such as activation, and cost function.

- ac.py: is a script to evaluate the trained neural network. It compares the predicted output
and the 'correct answers' from the test dataset, and calculates the accuracy and 
return the value.


- Data file is not uploaded, due to file size limit of github.
