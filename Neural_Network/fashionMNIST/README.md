### Feedforward Neural Network on FashionMNIST

- This is the neural network built from scrach without machine leanring libraries. Only libraries used was...
* NumPy: Matrix operations
* SciPy: sigmoid function
* Pandas: data preprocessing
* Matplotlib: visualization
* Time: measures training time

[fashionMNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset, fashion version of MNIST with images from Zalando, was used.
