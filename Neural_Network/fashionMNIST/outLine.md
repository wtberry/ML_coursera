## Outline for Jupyter Notebook on Neural Network ##

# Asusmptions that reader already know... #
  1. basic linear algebra
  2. familiarity of calculus and pre-calculus
  3. python

1. table of cont
2. basic idea/intuitions of NN on another page, if have time!
	1.  [[Neural_Net_structures]] 
		* diagram, input and output data, and visualize these data
		* Neuron Model: explain "one unit of neuron"
		* backpropagations
		* classification
	2.  [[Activation_function]]
		* theta and activation functions
	3. hypothesis
		* hypothesis
4. main function - 1week
	1. importing packages
	2. importing and preprocessing data
	3. setting up parameters for NN
	4. random data visualization
	5. initialize params
	6. set up and using optimization algorithm
	7. making prediction
6. functions
	1. sigmoid - 5days
		* activation function
		* What is sigmoid functioni??
		* show graphs and equations
		* relate to NN, how it comes in place 
		* Lastly, implementation with python and numpy
	2. costFunction: - 5days
		* feedforwarding, making predictions
		* BackPropagations
		* regularization
	3. sigmoidGradient - 5days
		* Basically taking derivetive of sigmoid
		* why did we need this again??
		* Equations
		* Implementations
	4. predict and accuracy - 5days
		* feedforward
